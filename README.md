# Soft
a soft and comfy programming language (well just half of a bytecode vm for now)

nothing serious, I'm just making it for fun. currently will only work on x86_64. if for some reason anyone ever wants to actually use anything I've written, feel free to, I'll try my best to support any issues, etc.

# Compiling

```shell
# build project
make

# build and run tests
make dev
make test
```

# Usage
none at the moment sorry :)
